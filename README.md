## Project Overview

This project evaluates various machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models on the **MQTTSET** dataset. The goal is to identify effective algorithms for attack prediction in IoT systems using MQTT protocols. Several models, such as GRU, LSTM, and RRN, have been analyzed to measure their performance across different metrics.
